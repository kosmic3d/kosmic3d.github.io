	<div style="margin-top:1em; margin-left: 4em; margin-right: 4em;">
        	<font face="arial" size="4">The first tech demo made in Worlds has been released, you can check it out in the main page, where it says Tech Demos. I have encountered with many bugs during the development of this tech demo, but it was worth it, I feel proud to have released my first tech demo, I never thought I would reach this goal.

	<div style="margin-top:1em; margin-left: 4em; margin-right: 4em;">
            <font face="arial" size="4">But I still was motivated to continue working on it, and today is the day I release it, some frustrations over there, but overall I had fun making it. In the future, I hope to bring more tech demos to the public and also start making a real game with my game engine.

        <div style="margin-top:1em; margin-left: 4em; margin-right: 4em;">
            <font face="arial" size="4">It has been 1 year since I started the development of the WORLDS engine. I started to create my own game engine on May 20th, 2021, by a simple tutorial online on how to use OpenGL. Now I have made my very own sprite format, a work in progress map editor and a work in progress multiplayer mode.

        <div style="margin-top:1em; margin-left: 4em; margin-right: 4em;">
            <font face="arial" size="4">Honestly, for being 1 person behind all of this is not actually that bad, at the time of writing this, I think I have achieved very little popularity, but I hope that changes in the future, maybe when I actually release something to the public.

        <div style="margin-top:1em; margin-left: 4em; margin-right: 4em;">
            <font face="arial" size="4">I am in the middle between realistic and idealistic, I want to believe my game engine will receive prominent popularity around the internet, but at the same time, I don't think it's going to be the biggest hit ever, but I hope it's good enough to make me feel satisfied.
